What is the price that I can get your time for? Answer yourself! And reread this question. Are you a programmer, scientist, teacher, or maybe a designer? So can I get you for $25 per hour or $40, $50 probably? What do you think? 

As we aren’t interacting with each other. I assume that you can be any full-stack developer and earn $40 dollars per hour<span style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.6;"> (Ignoring the tax deductions)</span>. Would you get hired by me if I offered you $35 per hour and the same benefits that your company offers? Assume everything is the same, but the only difference between the company you are working for now and working under me is “freedom”. I offer you freedom, I am not the boss, I will be your co-worker. 

What do you say? You just take the offer or calculate the $5 loss, summing up to $800 huge loss per month. If you say “Yes” to my offer then you are welcome onboard but if you find this isn’t convincing, let me re-write the offer again.

Again, Assume you are a full stack developer, drawing $40/hr in a good company with ample amount of benefits. Your parents would love to see you as a teacher who can change lives but you felt that’s the worst profession you could be in, so you never gave thought.  Now I come to offer you $50/hr if you could teach React and C++ to the Undergraduate students in my college. What do you say?

Would you like to raise your income to $1600 per month? Or simply ignore and walk away because this is what you never wanted to do? If you say a clear “No” then welcome onboard. I congratulate you on passing the test.

But if you say “yes” to the second offer, what about your ever-worst expectation from life? All those arguments happened with your family and friends. So you give up your decisions, opinions, and liberty for a certain price. That means all that you have said is a lie. You would have told anyone that you don’t want to be a teacher until and unless someone pays you more than this price. 

So you agree that you are not selling your skill, you are selling your freedom of choice. You can stop reading this if you love slavery but If you are someone who has this illusion that you are doing what you love and falling for more salary compromising on all the choices in your life then my friend! This is for you.

Not only you, even I love working for money. Because not everyone can be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank"> Nikola Tesla </a> who became a great scientist though he slept on floors in cold weather. Without a good mattress, protective clothes and a stomach full of food no one can survive longer happily and safely. After fulfilling the duties and responsibilities of the family, If you are still falling for the money then one day the only choice you are left with is “How much ?” instead of “Why should I ?”. 

The luxury won’t come to you by owning something, it comes to you by choosing something. Something that you love and prefer. It could be a new mobile or a couch in the living room, a new apparel or haircut, a job or freelancing, owning a Business or being at home, or anything that you wish to have. 

Be the priceless person who can’t be sold at any cost until you wish to do that out of your own will. Unfortunately, there are many influencers in this social media world and only a few thinkers. Don’t get influenced easily, if you are falling into the influencer trap remember that everything has a price and there are only a few thinkers who behave genuinely in providing the specific knowledge. 

**Be the thinker, Be Priceless, Be an alpha!**
